    <p>We hardly find an online video by Prof. Urtasun before the pandemic due to the IP with Uber. Now after a clear takeover of Uber self-driving units by Aurora, many curious unknowns are released, though we could read about their work previously from her website. It's a shame that she did not get an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">offer</a> to move to Aurora as their future development will be less transparent.

My personal take is driving is a very complex task. It cannot be simply decomposed into perception, planning and control, as we human learn to run and navigate from ancient times and they are hardwired in our brain. Replacing human drivers is impossible without a mature algorithm under <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/deepminds-new-ai-masters-games-without-even-been-taught-the-rules">investigation</a> by DeepMind.

    <p>It is a second interview with the car veterain. Since he got sick and didn't returned to car OEMs, he dares to point out the pain points in the traditional OEMs - short of budgets but a lot to invest in electrification and software, no resource, detrimental old mindsets in horizontal integration, etc. His <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/13/there-will-be-blood-peter-mertens-former-head-of-audi-rd-we-all-did-sleep/">first interview</a> is even thornier which sometimes I think it should not be spelled out. The shared video is overall a very insightful interview if people want to know the car industry as of now.</p>
    <p>It will be a painful journey for traditional OEMs to catch up in the development of OS like VW and Mercedes, and rapid expansion of EV's. For example, there is a big communication gap between the management and developers, and traditional car managers simply are not capable of taking a bottom-up approach. While <a href="https://youtu.be/JGfygJXTwq4?t=111">Tesla boss</a> can be called on a Sunday to resolve problems, traditional managers don't understand technical details and developers don't get the big picture. Consequently, the strategy made by the managers can be misleading while others don't have a clue. We will see a large number of M&amp;A's in OEM's in the next few years to weather the storm of vast spendings and market shrinkage in the area of their conventional strength. <p>

<td><p> It's fun to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnBH9mgT8-g&list=PLa5S6UwF22ILojGlOW4q_fBszqRjU41Tz">this</a> video series about what BMW plans for their cars of next generation. </p>
    <p> Simply put, a car is made of "chassis + load". The core competence of "chassis" includes electric motor, electric control units and battery, while that of "load" is software. The performance measure of electric cars is its range, whether is capable to cope with battery-consuming devices like air conditioner, and its recharging time. A good car software is evaluated by the safety/robustness in control and user experience. 
    </p>
    <p> Tesla is way ahead in both directions with superior roaming range, and end-to-end software. The "one-piece" product has been revolutionalizing the car industry, while lack of its engineering details. The other OEMs like BMW and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess">VW</a> are trying their best to catch up, but can they redesign cars from bottom up and skip the legacy? How to feed such a big investment and find good resource base?

</td>
<td></p>The keyword in this video is "system integration". It seems like a compromised approach to impede the aggression from Tesla, but really, due to the lack of budgets and local engineers, being "architects" in software development might be a good way forward. Owning OS is already a bold move as many failed cases are recalled in the phone age against iOS and Android. </p>
    <p>On the flip side, providing premium digital services requires continuously innovating the software products, which is why Tesla is widely regarded as a software firm thanks to its end-to-end software development and updates. Now traditional OEMs hope the "architects" could deep dive into the software to master the entire chain. However, without the in-house know-hows who have bottom-up experience and skill set in the development cycle, it is insufficient to drive such innovations .</p></td>
