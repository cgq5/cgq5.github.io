        <h1>Interesting Videos</h1>
        <p>The aim of this page is to share some interesting videos on the topic of self-driving cars, machine learning and robotics. It would be great to cultivate a forum to discuss the contents raised here. My current way is to use Github issues before I find a better solution. Feel free to propose a video and make a comment by raising an issue at Github <a href="https://github.com/cgq5/cgq5.github.io/issues">here</a>, or star/watch my repo if you like it and want to keep an update. Please note, the shared videos and my comments represent my personal views. </p>

<td></p>The keyword in this video is "system integration". It seems like a compromised approach to impede the aggression from Tesla, but really, due to the lack of budgets and local engineers, being "architects" in software development might be a good way forward. Owning OS is already a bold move as many failed cases are recalled in the phone age against iOS and Android. On the flip side, it is insufficient to drive innovations without the in-house know-hows who have bottom-up experience in the whole development cycle.</p></td>

<th>A future with affordable Self-driving vehicles</th>

    <p>    We hardly find an online video by Prof. Urtasun before the pandemic due to the IP with Uber. Now after a clear takeover of Uber self-driving units by Aurora, many curious unknowns are released, though we could read about their work previously from her website. It's a shame that she did not get an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">offer</a> to move to Aurora as their development will be less transparent. A video channel by the professor about many topics on self-driving cars can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLGGmIWc3Ia1jhKBNUsbBjg/videos">here</a>.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f-u0hgiLXw&list=PLHyI3Fbmv0ScWuUtrVfT9xCzxAcXtpLS5">This</a> is a wonderful list of AI talks in the context of self-driving cars. My personal take is driving a very complex task. It cannot be simply decomposed into perception, planning and control, as we human learn to run and navigate from ancient times and they are hardwired in our brain. Replacing human drivers is impossible without a mature algorithm under <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/deepminds-new-ai-masters-games-without-even-been-taught-the-rules">investigation</a> by Deepmind.
